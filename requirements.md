# Authentication and Authorization
## Use JWT for secure user sessions.
## Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
Guests
Hosts
Admins


## User Registration:
Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
## User Login and Authentication:
Implement login via email and password.
Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
# Profile Management:
Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.


## Add Listings:
Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
## Edit/Delete Listings:
Hosts can update or remove their property listings.


## Booking Creation:
Guests can book a property for specified dates.
Prevent double bookings using date validation.
## Booking Cancellation:
Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
## Booking Status:
Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.


## API Development
Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
GET (retrieve data)
POST (create data)
PUT/PATCH (update data)
DELETE (remove data)
Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

## validation
Implement login via email and password.
Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).


## 1. Scalability
Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.
## 2. Security
Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.
## 3. Performance Optimization
Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
Optimize database queries to reduce server load.
## 4. Testing
Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
